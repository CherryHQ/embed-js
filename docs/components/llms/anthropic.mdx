To use Anthropic's Claude models, you will need to get an API Key from Anthropic.
You can do this from their [console](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys). Once you obtain a key, set it in the environment variable, like so -

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="<Your key>"
```

## Install Anthtopic addon

```bash
npm install @cherrystudio/embedjs-anthropic
```

## Usage

```ts
import { RAGApplicationBuilder } from '@cherrystudio/embedjs';
import { Anthropic } from '@cherrystudio/embedjs-anthropic';

const app = await new RAGApplicationBuilder()
.setModel(new Anthropic({ modelName: "..." }))
```
